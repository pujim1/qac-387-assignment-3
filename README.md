# Python Code Assistant 

This project builds an AI powered "Python Code Assistant" using LangChain, OpenAI, and Streamlit. The tool allows the user to upload a Python file, and the tool will suggest improvements to make the code more readable/efficient. The tool will then output an improved version of the user's Python script. 


# Duplicating the .env File
To set up your environment variables, you need to duplicate the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`. You can do this manually or using the following terminal command:

```bash
cp .env.example .env # Linux, macOS, Git Bash, WSL
copy .env.example .env # Windows Command Prompt
```

This command creates a copy of `.env.example` and names it `.env`, allowing you to configure your environment variables specific to your setup.
